#this is how unedited seeds come.
#https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=50&type=multiple is the source, the only part that's important to know is that only type = multiple questions are supported by my program, but aside from that, go nuts.
#the things you have to do for it to run is
#remove type
#make the headers here symbols (delete quote marks,)
#remove the incorrecr answers array and recode them as in correct answers 1 2 and 3
#Probably some other stuff. I left the last seed I imported in the seeds.rb file
#Also, my program does allow you to have the question asked multiple times, maybe a way to improve it if you keep seeidng is to make a used question array that compares the id to ones asked. (just sayin)
#:) have fun!
