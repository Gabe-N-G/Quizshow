# Module One Project 

Congratulations, you're at the end of module one! You've worked crazy hard to get here and have learned a ton.

For your final project, we'll be building a Command Line database application.

Ok, so I'm hijacking this readme file. Thanks guys if you read this.

First of all, have fun, it's a basic run command in the bin folder to start the game.

Second of all, if you see any bugs report it to me and maybe we can make this a class project instead of a solo one!  I added some (more useful) comments in my code showing where some of the break points are. Also if you figure out a top 3 table that would be sick. 

Third of all, I'm gonna write instructions on how to seed the questions if you want to add more. I currently have ~100 questions seeded, but we can aim for the top! Basically all it takes is alot of manual labor :/. https://opentdb.com/api_config.php is the api I am scraping from. I'll keep an example of an un edited seed in "seed_to_format.rb" and what an edited seed to run into my program in "seeds.rb".

Thanks everyone!
